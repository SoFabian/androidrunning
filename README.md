# Android Running
Track your runs with this free Android app.

Made by a nerd for nerds.

This is for everybody who wants an app showing you all relevant information during your running session. (A counter example can be found in Runtastic for example where you don't even see your live heart rate, but I would not never pay a penny for a GPS tracker app)

Start intervals on demand.

See your absolved distance, duration, live/average pace, live/average heart rate, intervals, Google Maps view.

See your running history.

This is for everybody who wants a simple app not containing any marketing, coaching, pretty picture bloat seen in all other to-pay running apps.

## Installation hint
File 'local.properties' must contain key 'MAPS_API_KEY' with your Google Maps API Key as value.
